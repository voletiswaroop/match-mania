3. Restart: Reset will restart the game.
4. Star Rating: The rating varies from 3 to 1 star based on the number of clicks.
   1. If the player completes the game in 15 moves then the player will get 3 stars
   2. If the player completes the game in between 16 to 30 moves then the player will get 2 stars.
   3. If the player completes the game in morethan 30 moves then the player will get 1 star.
